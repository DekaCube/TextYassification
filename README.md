Harry Potter had never been able to celebrate his birthday with friends before. But this year, everything was different. Not only was he finally turning thirteen, but he was also staying at the Burrow with the Weasley family. It was a surreal experience, waking up to the sound of chickens clucking and the smell of freshly baked bread wafting up from the kitchen.

Ron and Hermione had already given him presents - a new broomstick servicing kit from Hermione and a book on Quidditch moves from Ron. Harry couldn't wait to try out both gifts once he got back to Hogwarts. He was feeling more grateful than ever for his friends, especially after the past year's events with Sirius Black and the dementors.

But as they sat down to breakfast, Harry couldn't help but feel a twinge of anxiety. Today was the day they were going to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies, and Harry was still unsure of how he would pay for everything. He had enough money left over from last year, but he wasn't sure if it would be enough to cover everything he needed.
